# Simple react App

This app is a sample application to illustrate the concept of events, event handling and component state in react

## Steps to handling events

1. Decide what kind of event you want to watch for
2. Create a function (an event handler or callback function)
3. Name the function using the pattern handle + EventName (Community convention)
4. Pass the function as a prop to a plain element
5. Ensure to pass the function using a valid event name (eg. 'onClick', 'onMouseOver', 'onChange', etc)
6. Ensure to pass a reference to the function

# Handling state

The react state system is use to handle data that changes as the user interacts with an application. When the data changes, React updates the content displayed on the screen automatically.

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
